## Awesome ToDo list apps
> [!WARNING]
> For the purposes of this review, we are only looking at **free** plans!

| Name | Notification (Reminder) | Calendar | Speed Capture | Note
| ----- | --- | -- | -- | -- |
| [TickTick](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/reviews/00Eci0pqG2SVLDs8vlNv0s4-15.fit_lim.size_1050x.png) | ✔ Good | ❌ No | ✔ Good | Ideal for ToDo tasks. Great for notifications!
| [Todoist](https://dl.flathub.org/repo/screenshots/com.todoist.Todoist-stable/1248x702/com.todoist.Todoist-1b2c0318c8519755e25f4df8ebd923a3.png) | ❌ No | ✔ Yes (google) | ✔ Good | Suitable for a quick capture, but simple on its own
| [Any.do](https://www.any.do/v5/images/teams/my-team.webp) | ❌ No | ✔ Yes | ❌ Slowly | Handy for managing "calendar" tasks, block time, schedule and planing
| TwosApp | | ✔ Yes | | Combine application for task management 

As you can see in **my usage scenario** TickTick wins. The app has free and dynamic management of repetitive tasks and also has constant reminders that are always triggered on the phone and never missed (e.g. on the aggressive EMUI shell).
